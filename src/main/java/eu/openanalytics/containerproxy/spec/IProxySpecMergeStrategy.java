 * This interface defines the strategy that should be used to obtain a final, ready-to-use ProxySpec
 * from a specific input.
 * <p>
 * The input can be divided into three components:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The base spec, which is retrieved from the application configuration file based on its unique id.</li>
 * <li>A runtime spec, which can be provided by the caller to the API when requesting the launch of a Proxy.</li>
 * <li>A set of runtime settings, which can be provided by the caller to the API when requesting the launch of a Proxy.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p><p>
 * The strategy may choose to allow or prohibit certain combinations of input. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The strategy may allow only a base spec, with no runtime spec or settings to merge.</li>
 * <li>The strategy may allow only a runtime spec, and no base specs are defined anywhere.</li>
 * <li>The strategy may allow a base spec, with an optional runtime spec OR an optional set of runtime settings.</li>
 * </ul>
